    <p class="paragraph">Hello, my name is Benjamin Bauer. I am a IBEW local 640 electritian, I am currently working on
      learning and getting into a career in web development. I have had a love and passion for creating through code,
      web pages since taking STRUT A+ back in high school. my biggest regret is not following on that passion. Now after
      having two completly different careers, I am working on getting intot he field of web development and programing.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">I want to make web sites through my love of coding and also branch off into programs and games.
      I am currently working through <a class="link" href="theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a> courses and
      supplementing my learning with the books: Head First JavaScript second edition and Eloquent JavaScript.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">My career experience started after finishing four years of college at Chandler-Gilbert
      Community College. Once I completed my time there, I followed my father into law enforcement. I became a second
      generation Corrections Officer. My Dad was a Corrections Officer at the Alaska State Prison at the Anchorage
      Complex. I remember back when I was really young, bring your kid to work days (way back in the 90s) I got to sit
      in the control room with him and watch the inmates in their cells around us. Deffinately not a normal experience
      for a kid and I never met anyone that had such an experince like that as a child.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">I spent just shy of nine years working for the Arizona State Department of Corrections, Eyman
      Complex. Six of those years was spent as an Officer, The other two plus years I was a Sergeant at Browning Unit, a
      level 5 max security unit. I dealt mainly with the inmates on deathrow and the prison and street gangs.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">After my time I spent at the prison, a fellow Officer I worked with left and for a year he
      would call me and try to talk me into leaving the prison and go become a Union Electrician. I finally agreed and
      spent 4 years in the IBEW apprentaceship. I have been with the same company for coming up to seven years in
      January. This last year I have been working mainly on motor control systems. I build RTU cabinets and various
      other panels for all the well sites and lift stations around the toewn of Queen Creek Arizona. I am now looking at
      making a change and pursuing my passion for computers and coding.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">more to come...</p>
